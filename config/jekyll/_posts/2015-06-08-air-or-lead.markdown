#air or lead

What is your love like?

Is it like a gentle uplifting breeze carrying those you hold dear high among the clouds to bask in the warm sunlight?

Or is it like a shackle tethering them to the ground...safe, protected and unable to discover the world or themselves fully?

What sort of love would you like to receive? And what kind of love are you prepared to give?

When you look beyond your intentions, what lies yonder?
