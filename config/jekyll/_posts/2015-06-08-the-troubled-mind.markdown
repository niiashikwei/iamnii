#the troubled mind

The troubled mind,
like a storm sky,
it rolls tumbles and swirls out of control.
 
The troubled mind,
a mass of pulsating energy,
a trove of limitless possibility.
 
The troubled mind,
fuel to my anger,
fuel to my beating heart.
 
Have you felt that kind of limitless rage,
the rage a troubled mind spurns and fuels,
the power and feeling of omnipotence it grows with every ragged breath?
 
A nuclear bomb in the making,
Boom! Bang! KaBOOM!
It roars and thunders, destroying and transforming.
 
Limitless Power and yet,
here i stand,
alone, and in Ashes...
