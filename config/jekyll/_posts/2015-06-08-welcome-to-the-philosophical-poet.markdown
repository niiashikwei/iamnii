# Welcome to 'the philosophical poet'!

This blog is an outlet for me to share some of the random thoughts and insights I gain whenever they hit me.
Hope you enjoy reading and that you find some of my pieces thought provoking.
The first 8 posts will be a few pieces from my younger days. Moving forward I'll be added content as and when I feel inspired to do so.
Thanks for visiting and feel free to share links to any pieces that you find interesting.
