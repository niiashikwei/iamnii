#stranger in the mirror

Who are you? What do you want from me?
Do not stare at me so familiarly and do not mock me with your perfect mimicry!
Wait now I understand, oh silly me.

How is it possible that I did not recognize you? How can it be that you're a part of me?
I've defined myself by ethics and standards yet proudly you stand as you defy them.
You are me, and I am you, but we are not the same.

We are opposite colors on a yin and yang symbol, how that can be is very simple.
If white be light, and black be darkness, as they have been and will be eternally
You are that little bit of evil, keeping me from being completely pure,
You are that little bit of goodness, keeping me from being completely impure.

I hate you but I need you, you're an elixir but yet still a poison.
You twist and trap me only to set me free.
Disappoint me and then impress me, all with glee

If you will not help me, leave me be!
Do not reinforce bad definitions of me,
And do not do good unnecessarily!
Lest people misunderstand the complex entity that I be
