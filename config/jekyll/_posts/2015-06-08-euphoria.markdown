#euphoria

What is this feeling that swells within my chest?
It swells like an inflating balloon, like an over fed tummy
Slow and steady... 
A rolling stone gathering no moss.

Why do I suddenly feel like i can fly?
Not so long ago I was being ground to dust by a titanic force
My weeping soul locked behind a wall of pride,
My bleeding heart, desperately beating against a resolute ribcage.

But these days it's different...
It feels like I have died and been reborn with a limitless supply of positivity...
It feels like I'm yet to see billions of sunrises...
It feels like everything is gonna work out just fine...

If in the yesterdays of yesterday i was a rock,
Being Eroded and washed away by violent river,
Today I am a fluffy cirrus cloud, 
Drifting on a warm, gentle and uplifting breeze. 

Like some of the best things that happen to us in life.
This recent development bears no explanation.
I could spend forever trying to figure it out...
Or I could do my best to make today last an eternity.

Pure bliss and satisfaction down one road, 
pure chaos and confusion down the other,
The choice isn't a hard one.
