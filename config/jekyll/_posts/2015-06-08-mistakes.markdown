#mistakes

Everybody makes them,
And everybody hates them.
Making a mistake is like rolling dice..
You know exactly what combination or number your going for..
But the probability that you'll get it ...
Is always far less than the probability that you won't.
 
Bummer.
 
Congratulate those around you that seem to be flawless,
Or even just not nearly as flawed as you think you are..
These are either angels,
Or hypocritical actors who have mastered the art of keeping their secrets to themselves,
And on occasion, Lying to themselves so well that even they...
Even they, believe the utter nonsense that they spew.
 
We are all alike, plus or minus a few laughs,
A few bad choices, a few unusual circumstances,
A few bad twists of fate, fortune and luck.
Under the right conditions we're all capable of the same things.
