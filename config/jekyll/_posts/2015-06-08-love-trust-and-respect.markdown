#love, trust and respect

What is love? Does anybody truly know? 
I could say a million good things about love, I could say a million bad things about it too
But at the end of the day is it bad or is it good? Or maybe just misunderstood? 
Does everyone feel the same thing or do we all define it uniquely to suite ourselves? 
They say the greatest feeling in the world is to love and be loved, but is it really? 
Is not the worst feeling in the world to love and not be loved in return? 
What hurts more? To love and not be loved, or to love and not be loved as much? 
Why is it we either stay away from the people we love the most or can't stand to be away from them for a single second? 
Why does love attract as much as it repels? Why does this one emotion reap as much happiness as sorrow?

What is Trust? Is it what keeps us from breaking our promises? 
Or is it a tool we use to keep others from breaking theirs? 
Is it right to trust someone with your life knowing that they may have to trade theirs to save yours? 
Is it wrong to be smart about trusting people because you respect that they may need to break their trust with you in order to keep the trust they have for themselves? Which is more important? Trusting others, or trusting yourself? If we say we trust someone, should we not then be happy with all the choices they make that may or may not affect us? 
Should we not have faith that in the long run their decisions are for the better?
Hmmm...do we ever really believe we can trust someone or do we just need to believe it? 
Is trust a pretentious belief perpetuated in society that the smarter few may use it to bend other to their will?

What is Respect? Should it be earned or given freely? 
Should we respect people for what they do? 
Or for what they say? 
Why respect someone that doesn't respect you? 
Why disrespect someone because they don't respect you? We all want respect, but how often do we give it? 
Does it not ever seem like the more respect you give, the less you receive? 
Has the world not shown us that depending on the situation anything can be respected, good and bad? Does respect not seem more to be measured by achievement than quality of character? 
Do you realize some people get more respect from disrespecting than from respecting?

Love, Trust and Respect do we give them as much thought as we should? Or do we give them too much thought to begin with?
